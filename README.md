# Text File Reader

This is an old project I made to test out C#. It is a .NET Framework CLI tool reads the contents of a text file and prints it to the console. 

## Features

- **File Reading:** Reads the entire content of a specified text file.
- **File Existence Check:** Verifies that the file exists before attempting to read it.
- **Console Output:** Displays the file content on the console.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 5.0 or later recommended)
- A text editor or IDE such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
